# Transformer Project

This project implements a transformer model for various tasks such as translation, summarization, and more.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `models/`: Holds the transformer model components such as the encoder, decoder, and attention mechanisms.
- `training/`: Contains scripts and configurations for training the model.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts for data processing, metrics, and logging.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for the model.
- `documentation/`: Documentation on model architecture, usage, and examples.
- `scripts/`: Data preprocessing and downloading scripts.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

1.Train the model:python training/scripts/train.pyEvaluate the model:python training/scripts/evaluate.pyInference:python training/scripts/inference.pyEnvironmentAlternatively, you can set up the environment using conda:conda env create -f environment.ymlLet me know if you need more details or additional files!
