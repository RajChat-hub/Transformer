# Transformer Model Architecture

The transformer model consists of the following components:

1. **Encoder**: Encodes the input sequence into a latent representation.
2. **Decoder**: Decodes the latent representation into an output sequence.
3. **Attention Mechanisms**: Self-attention layers allow the model to focus on different parts of the input.
4. **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of words in the input sequence.
5. **Feedforward Layers**: Provides non-linearity between layers in the encoder and decoder.
