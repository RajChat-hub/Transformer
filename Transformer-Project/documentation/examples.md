# Examples of Using the Transformer Model

## Example 1: Sequence-to-Sequence Translation

1. Prepare your source and target sequences in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Preprocess the data using the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess_data.py

1. Train the model and use it to translate sequences from one language to another.

     Example 2: Text Summarization

 1. Use the training and inference scripts with a dataset of text documents.

2. The transformer will summarize each document after training.
